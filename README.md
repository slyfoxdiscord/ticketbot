Do **not** claim this as your own, the only reason this is open source is to show what we store/have access to

This is mainly open source for educational purposes

This repo is almost guaranteed to be further behind on updates than the actual bot

If you decide to download this, and use it, either personally, or for a team, at the very least leave a star, but ideally put some credits/attribution.
